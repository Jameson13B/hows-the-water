        <b>About the Site -</b> After my first time reading{' '}
        {affiliateLink('This is Water')}, I knew I wanted to share it with
        others. Share how I felt, some of my thoughts, and the book itself.
        After spending time telling others about the book and recommending it as
        much as possible, I came up with the idea of How's the Water. I started
        by purchasing five hardcover copies of the book <em>This is Water</em> (
        <em>Alpha</em>,<em> Bravo</em>,<em> Charlie</em>,<em> Delta</em>, and
        <em> Echo</em>
        ), wrote a message on the inside of each, and created this website.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Those three books were given to friends with simple instructions. Read
        the book, share on the website, and give the book to someone else.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        This website accomplishes two tasks. It provides others the opportunity
        to share their thoughts, feelings, advice, etc. It also provides a forum
        of shared entries to inspire you, help you grow, and provide new
        insight.

        <b>About the Book -</b> Only once did David Foster Wallace give a public
        talk on his views on life, during a commencement address given in 2005
        at Kenyon College. The speech is reprinted for the first time in book
        form in {affiliateLink('This is Water')}. How does one keep from going
        through their comfortable, prosperous adult life unconsciously? How do
        we get ourselves out of the foreground of our thoughts and achieve
        compassion? The speech captures Wallaceâ€™s electric intellect as well as
        his grace in attention to others. After his death, it became a treasured
        piece of writing reprinted in The Wall Street Journal and the London
        Times, commented on endlessly in blogs, and emailed from friend to
        friend. Writing with his one-of-a-kind blend of causal humor, exacting
        intellect, and practical philosophy, David Foster Wallace probes the
        challenges of daily living and offers advice that renews us with every
        reading.
