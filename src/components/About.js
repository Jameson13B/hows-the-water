      <h2>About the Book</h2>
      <Paragraph>
        Only once did David Foster Wallace give a public talk on his views on
        life, during a commencement address given in 2005 at Kenyon College. The
        speech is reprinted for the first time in book form in{' '}
        <span> This is Water</span>. How does one keep from going through their
        comfortable, prosperous adult life unconsciously? How do we get
        ourselves out of the foreground of our thoughts and achieve compassion?
        The speech captures Wallaceâ€™s electric intellect as well as his grace in
        attention to others. After his death, it became a treasured piece of
        writing reprinted in The Wall Street Journal and the London Times,
        commented on endlessly in blogs, and emailed from friend to friend.
